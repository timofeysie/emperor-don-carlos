# Emperor Don Carlos

An Ionic Angular app with dynamic theming.


## In the beginning

This project was cloned from the GitHub repo for Episode 128 - Custom Theme Generator in Ionic 4.
The code was from a Firebase [article](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/css-variables-in-ionic-4/#CSS-Variable-Basics) on using CSS variables and Ionic to override the theme dynamically.
